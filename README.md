# Test SPARTED


## How to use

The project is "simple" . It uses an Open API and shows images using css grid layout

 - Clone the project
 - run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
 - run `npm start` to see the result in chrome


This is how i responde to an exercise i've got from SPARTED.

The exercise statement is not disclosed here.

Maybe all of this should have been kept secret ;)
